# Sketch Plugin - Text Extractor

This Sketch plugin allows you to export text layers to `.CSV` files. Useful to
export strings to be translated.

### How to use
- Install the plugin
- Select a couple of text layers (it will ignore any accidentally selected non-text layers)
- Go to Plugins > Extract Text Selection
- Specify the folder you want to save the file to
- Profit! 🎉

### Special thanks
The creator of the [Sketch Export Text Plugin](https://github.com/exevil/Sketch-Export-Text).
The workflow of that plugin slightly missed our point, so Tim ([@timthing](https://github.com/timthing)) and I decided to create a
new plugin that would match more with our expectations. We think the [Sketch Export Text Plugin](https://github.com/exevil/Sketch-Export-Text) is a fantastic plugin, but we needed a bit more flexibility.

### Next
We'll be updating this plugin with some new features soon so keep a close watch!
